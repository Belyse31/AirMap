## Sample Narration Script

```
[0:00 - 0:30] Introduction
"Welcome to AirMap - a comprehensive IoT air quality monitoring platform. 
Built with React and Node.js, AirMap provides real-time insights into air 
pollution levels across your city using connected sensors."

[0:30 - 1:30] Live Map
"The heart of AirMap is this interactive map. Each marker represents an 
active sensor, color-coded by Air Quality Index. Green means good air, 
yellow is moderate, and red indicates unhealthy levels. Click any marker 
to see detailed readings for PM2.5, PM10, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. 
The heatmap overlay visualizes pollution density, and you can even travel 
back in time using the time slider to see how air quality changes throughout the day."

[1:30 - 2:30] Device Management
"Managing sensors is straightforward in the Device Hub. Search and filter 
through your devices, check their status, and view detailed information. 
Each device page shows current readings, historical trends, and location. 
Adding new sensors is as simple as clicking on a map - perfect for scaling 
your monitoring network."

[2:30 - 3:15] Analytics
"The analytics dashboard transforms raw sensor data into actionable insights. 
Compare air quality across different neighborhoods, identify pollution patterns, 
and track improvements over time. These visualizations help communities make 
data-driven decisions about environmental health."

[3:15 - 3:45] Real-Time Updates
"Everything updates in real-time using WebSocket technology. Watch as new 
readings flow in from sensors, updating maps and charts instantly. This 
live connection ensures you always have the most current air quality information."

[3:45 - 4:00] Conclusion
"AirMap makes environmental monitoring accessible, transparent, and actionable. 
Start monitoring your community's air quality today. Visit our GitHub repository 
to get started."
